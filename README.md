# **docker-and-docker-compose**
this lets you install docker &amp; docker compose in one line

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
- it checks for python3
- it installs (and it automatically makes it so that you dont have to type sudo whenever you run a docker command)

## WARNING
- please restart or log out and back in so that docker can be ran without sudo
- make sure you are on an up to date debian system
