# **ez-portainer-install**
this lets you install portainer, docker, and docker compose, alongside all of the required dependencies in one line

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
- while installing it asks you questions and tells you anything important
- it installs (and it automatically makes it so that you dont have to type sudo whenever you run a docker command)

## WARNING
- please restart or log out and back in so that docker can be ran without sudo
- make sure you are on an up to date debian system (idk if this works on another enviroment)
